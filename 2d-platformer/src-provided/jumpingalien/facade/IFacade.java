/**
 * Implement this interface to connect your code to the graphical user interface
 * (GUI).
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>For separating the code that you wrote from the code that was provided to
 * you, put <b>ALL your code in the <code>src</code> folder.</b> The code that
 * is provided to you stays in the <code>src-provided</code> folder.
 * Note: classes that belong to some package can be spread over multiple source
 * folders. For example, two classes, one in <code>src</code> and one in
 * <code>src-provided</code>, can be declared to belong to the same package,
 * even though they are not located in the same source folder.</li>
 * 
 * <li>You should at least <b>create the following classes</b> in the package
 * <code>jumpingalien.model</code>:
 * <ul>
 * <li>a class <code>Mazub</code> for representing Mazub the alien</li>
 * <li>a class <code>World</code> for representing the game world</li>
 * <li>a class <code>Sneezewort</code> for representing Sneezewort</li>
 * <li>a class <code>Skullcab</code> for representing Skullcab</li>
 * <li>a class <code>Shark</code> for representing a shark enemy</li>
 * <li>a class <code>Slime</code> for representing a slime enemy</li>
 * <li>a class <code>School</code> for representing a slime school</li>
 * </ul>
 * You may, of course, add additional classes as you see fit.
 * 
 * <li>You should <b>create a class <code>Facade</code></b> that implements this
 * interface. This class should be placed <b>in the package
 * <code>jumpingalien.facade</code></b>.</li>
 * 
 * <li>
 * The <b>header of that Facade class</b> should look as follows:<br>
 * <code>class Facade implements IFacade { ... }</code><br>
 * Consult the <a href=
 * "http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html">
 * Java tutorial</a> for more information on interfaces, if necessary.</li>
 *
 * <li>Your <code>Facade</code> class should offer a <b>default constructor</b>.
 * </li>
 * 
 * <li><b>Each method</b> defined in the interface <code>IFacade</code> must be
 * implemented by the class <code>Facade</code>. For example, the implementation
 * of <code>getActualPosition</code> should call one or more methods on the given
 * <code>alien</code> to retrieve its current location.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Methods in this interface are <b>only allowed to throw exceptions of type
 * <code>jumpingalien.util.ModelException</code></b> (this class is provided).
 * No other exception types are allowed. This exception can be thrown only if
 * calling a method of your classes with the given parameters would (1) violate
 * a precondition or (2) if the method of your throws an exception (if so,
 * wrap the exception in a <code>ModelException</code>).</li>
 * 
 * <li><b>ModelException should not be used anywhere outside of your Facade
 * implementation.</b></li>
 * 
 * <li>Your Facade implementation should <b>only contain trivial code</b> (for
 * example, calling a method, combining multiple return values into an array,
 * creating @Value instances, catching exceptions and wrapping it in a
 * ModelException). All non-trivial code should be placed in the other classes
 * that you create.</li>
 * 
 * <li>The rules described above and the documentation described below for each
 * method apply only to the class implementing IFacade. <b>Your class for
 * representing aliens should follow the rules described in the assignment.</b></li>
 * 
 * <li><b>Do not modify the signatures</b> of the methods defined in this
 * interface.</li>
